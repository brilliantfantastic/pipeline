pipeline / A simple way to plan your work week
==============================================
***

## DESCRIPTION

We all have busy lives. We need a way to help us focus on what to work on for a given week without a lot of work maintaining a system.

Pipeline allows you to plan your work week by splitting up hours between projects. Time is recorded against these projects using 
Freshbooks or Harvest (systems you already use to track your time).

Emails are sent to you throughout the week to help you keep focus.
